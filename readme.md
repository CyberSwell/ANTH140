# What is this project?
My Anthropology of Alcohol professor mentioned that the liquor shops in the area typically stock up on Crown Russe before football games (upwards of 1k units per store), and it's "funny" to see them sell out by Sunday/ Monday. 

I have created this script to compile the data into a CSV for visualization of inventory over time for various stores in the area.
